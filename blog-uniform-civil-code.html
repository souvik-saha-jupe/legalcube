        <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;The founding fathers of Indian Constitution was of the view that the provision relating to uniform civil code should be included in the fundamental rights thus should be made justifiable. 
           Though the committee was divided as there was distinct perception on the view towards uniform civil code.
           Whereas article 44 of the constitution of India requires the state to strive to secure for its citizen as common civil code throughout India.
        
            This moreover implies that constitution should  frame laws prevailing over religious injunctions governing :
             <ul style="list-style-type:circle" class="blogclass">
                <li>Marriage and Divorce</li>
                <li>Custody and Guardianship</li>
                <li>Adoption and Maintenance</li>
                <li>Succession and inheritance</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The aspect and post outcome of uniform civil code,Is a controversy revolving around secularism and freedom of religion.
            Article 25 and 26 of Indian Constitution guarantee right to freedom of religion, Article 25 guarantee to every person that
             freedom of conscience and right to profess, practice and propagate religion. But this right is subject to public order morality 
             and health and to the other provision of part 3 of the constitution. Article 25 also empowers the state to regulate or restrict any 
             economic financial political or other secular activities which may be associated with religious practice and also to provide for social
              welfare and reforms.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The problem in the way of implementation of uniform civil code is that it affects the religious 
            belief. <i>In S.R.Bommai v. Union of India, it was precisely pointed out that
                “religion is the matter of individual faith and cannot be mixed with secular activities”. 
                Law regulates only the secular activities. When such activities run counter to public order,
                 morality or gender equality or a policy of social welfare upon which the State has embarked,
                  then the state becomes obliged to make for welfare of the people as a whole. </i> 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <i>
               &emsp;&emsp;This has made the Supreme Court to keep repeatedly prodding the union government for the 
            implementation of the Uniform Civil Code. The Judicial reminders began in 1985 in the case 
            of Mohammad Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum[1], popularly known as the Shah Bano case. In this
            case the apex court ruled that a Muslim woman was entitled to alimony under the Section 125
            of the CrPC, like anybody else.  The then Chief Justice, Y.V. Chandrachud made an observation
            stating that, “a common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing 
            disparate loyalties to law which have conflicting ideologies”. Following this, came the Sarla 
            Mudgal v. Union of India[2] where, the issue was whether a Hindu husband, married as per the 
            norms of Hindu law, can solemnize second marriage by embracing Islam. The Court held that the
            first marriage can be dissolved under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The first marriage would 
            therefore, still be valid and under Hindu law. Under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 
            the second marriage, solemnized after his conversion, and would be illegal. The Supreme Court
            in John Vallamatton v. Union of India[3] struck down Section 118 of the Indian Succession Act 
            stating that it was discriminatory against the Christians as it imposed unreasonable restrictions
            on their donation of property for religious or charitable purpose by will. The Court has reminded 
            the government to have a re-look into Article 44 of Indian Constitution, which suggest Uniform 
            civil code for the citizens.

            </i>
            
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Uniform civil code forms part of directive principle of constitution. The question arises 
            why it was not enforced at the time of framing the constitution? Ambedkar hoovers the founding
             father of constitution agreed that unless uniform civil code has consensus of all the people it 
             will never be implemented, it would not be forced.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The other side of the coin says uniform civil code is clothed with political aspets.  
            India fell in line with other Islamic countries that banned triple talaq. A bill criminalizing
            triple talaq was passed in Lok Sabha in December 2017, amid protest from opposition parties. 
            The house members rejected several amendments moved by opposition members before passing the bill.
            The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 criminalizes triple talaq or 
            instant divorce and has provision for a maximum three-year jail term and fine for practicing 
            triple talaq. It also gives Muslim women right to seek maintenance and right to child’s custody.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;This is a step towards Uniform Civil Code. Personal Law gives Muslims only, the right to be 
            governed by Shariah injunctions in the personal matters of marriage, inheritance, property 
            rights and religious observance. Commercial and criminal law is the same for all Indians.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The most important demand of Muslims should be that they be treated equally in secular India. 
            Constitution gives them equal rights and opportunities as all other Indians. Muslims should 
            seek to ensure that they are not discriminated against discreetly. They should demand same 
            protection of their rights and property. I do not believe that as long as the Muslims demand 
            to be treated differently in matters of personal law, others will view it as sheer aggrandizement
            of undeserved privileges. Let them reconcile to such inconsistency.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>

                &emsp;&emsp;“A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing 
            disparate loyalties to law which have conflicting ideologies”
            </i>
             Justice R.M. Sahai. He said:
             <i>
                “Ours is a secular democratic republic. Freedom of religion is the core of our culture. 
            Even the slightest of deviation shakes the social fibre. But religious practices, violative 
            of human rights and dignity and sacerdotal suffocation of essentially civil and material 
            freedom are not autonomy but oppression. Therefore, a unified code is imperative, both for 
            protection of the oppressed and for promotion of national unity and solidarity.”
             </i>
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <i>
                &emsp;&emsp;Who is the government to decide about my religion?
            </i>
            The constitution provides for the right to freedom of religion of One's choice. With 
            codification of uniform rules and its compulsion the scope of freedom of religion will be reduced.
            The wide diversity of our nation is making it regid implementation of uniform civil code.
            Uniform civil code is not a part of the Indian constitution, it is a part of the Directive 
            principles of the State policy which in turn was only written to serve as “guideline/goal” 
            for Indian lawmakers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;No other county is as diverse as India. In countries like the USA which are secular, 
            the concept of secularism is much different from India. While India has a secularism 
            in which the government actively promotes and protects the different religions, other
            countries think of religion as a sphere distinct from the sphere of the state.
            Everyone gets the <i>'special privileges'</i> , it wont be <i>'special'</i>  any more and everyone will 
            be called secular. Is that acceptable?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Since secularism is being questioned here, I disagree that bowing down to the UCC bullying 
            is the test of secularism for Indian Muslims. Similarly chanting 'Vande Mataram' is not a test 
            for patriotism for us.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Personal laws are under the concurrent list of the 7th schedule. This means that even the State 
            is allowed to enact legislation in this regard. So, UCC would devoid the States of this power and 
            concentrate the power with the center. He suggests that, instead of UCC, peacemeal changes in the 
            discriminatory practices of the various religions shall be made. So, in this light, various 
            Initiatives have been time and again undertaken by the Supreme court, the parliament to ensure 
            that personal laws remain just and fair.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Supreme court has established a “ Essential practice doctrine”according to which, religious
            practices which are non-essential and cause harm to the social interest or human dignity, 
            could be rectified. Judgements ranging from Shah-Bano (1985) to Saira-bano (2017) where it
            declared the practice of Tripal Talaq as Un Islamic ( non-essential practice) and thus void.
            The law commission report on reforms family law(2018 )comments that an uniform civil code is 
            “neither necessary not desirable at this stage”. According to the commission the best way forward 
            maybe to preserve the diversity of personal law but at the same time ensure that they do not 
            contradict fundamental rights.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;It is argued that the” legislation should first considered guaranteeing equality within
            communities between men and women rather than equality between communities”. This way some 
            of the differences within personal law which are meaningful can be preserved and inequality
            can be waved off out to the greatest extent possible without absolute uniformity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;So, what do we need? A Uniform Civil Code? I would argue, rather we need an Active judiciary,
            effective legislation and morally conscious citizens.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;It should be a code, which is just and proper according to a man of ordinary prudence, 
            without any bias with regards to religious and political considerations.
            But to conclude, I would like to say that citizens belonging to different religions
            and denominations follow different property and matrimonial laws which is not only affront 
            to the nation’s unity, but also makes one wonder whether we are sovereign secular republic
            or loose confederation of feudal states, where people live at the whims and fancies of mullahs,
            bishops and pundits.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Justice Kuldip Singh said Article 44 had to be retrieved from the cold storage
            where it was lying since 1949. The Justice referred to the codification of the Hindu personal 
            law and held, <i>"Where more than 80 % of the citizens have already been brought under the codified
                personal law there is no justification whatsoever to keep in abeyance, any more, the introduction
                of the ‘uniform civil code’ for all the citizens in the territory of India."

            </i> 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Indian society has been long fragmented in the name of religion, sect and gender. 
            Different laws govern the rights of different communities in personal matters like marriage, 
            divorce, maintenance, adoption and inheritance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;On the other hand In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately
            govern adherents of different religions. Jains and Buddhists are governed under Hindu code. 
            Sikhs, Parsis, Muslims and Christians have their own personal laws based on their religious 
            traditions. Many Tribals and Buddhists too oppose applicability of Hindu code or UCC to them.
            Minorities will always have more to loose than majority in Civil Code formation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;To conclude, as the famous communitarian thinker , Micheal Walzer once said 
            <i>"Justice is Not the science of Homogenization, rather it is an act of differentiation. There are different spheres of justice."</i>
